One effective approach to achieve this is by measuring brain activity. Neurophysiology refers to the study of the functioning of the nervous system, and assessing brain activity provides valuable insights into an athlete\'s neurological health. Techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) can help measure brain activity and detect any abnormalities or patterns that may indicate potential risks.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
